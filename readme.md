# My Porfolio

I have remade my portfolio from scratch using vanilla javascript, css, and html. It has some nice animation on the home screen and nice project page...except the code is still messy as of now. It's also worth noting my resume isn't finished yet so the resume page is just an <iframe> of a google doc so it updates for me. I am working on fixing it up but will soon make it from scratch once again when I am more comfortable with React or another framework.
